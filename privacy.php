                        an index page to the data you have uploaded. This index page also
                        allows you to aggregate and/or compare your datasets.</li>
                    <li>We store your email address, which will only be used for password
                        reset requests and the initial account set-up confirmation.</li>
                    <li>Your uploaded data is kept private; we will not make use of your data
                        or provide access to others.</li>
                    <li>Cookies are used to record that you have logged in, and, optionally,
                        to store the configuration of the filters in the index page.</li>
                    <li>You will receive an email asking you to agree to these uses of your
                        data when you create your account.</li>
